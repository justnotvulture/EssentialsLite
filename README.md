# EssentialsLite

Version 0.2

I don't really know what goes in a readme, but I figured this would be useful if other people ever use this. so...
- Don't claim this is yours, because it isn't.
- Install it just like any other Minecraft Plugin.
- You're not allowed to get mad if this breaks something because I never claimed that it wouldn't.
- I'm always willing to accept free Ice cream if you want to buy me some.
