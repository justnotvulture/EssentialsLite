# EssentialsLite

Version 0.2.1

This plugin is intended to be a lite version of the popular Essentials plugin. Some commands and featres seemed unnecessary or redundant to me
such as the give and enchant commands added by regular essentials. While still in very early development, I hope to get this plugin to the point
where it is comparable to the original version and it's newer variants.

Update Notes:
- Changed the syntax of the flyspeed command
- Fixed: Flyspeed not working on other players

Known issues:
- none

Previous Versions:
